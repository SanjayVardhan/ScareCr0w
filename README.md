# ScareCr0w

A Tool which finds vulnerabilities in programs, generates patches, and fixes it.

It uses openai api under the hood to find the vulnerabilities.


## V2:
1. Added support for small codebases.
2. Added multiprocessing.
3. A little better vuln detection.

## TODO:

1. Better vuln detection.
2. Patch generation is still not consistent, Need to tweak the parameters.
3. Need to think of a better approach to handle larger codebases.
